Description

Registers your on-premises server or virtual machine with Amazon EC2 so that you can manage these resources using Run Command. An on-premises server or virtual machine that has been registered with EC2 is called a managed instance. For more information about activations, see `Setting Up Systems Manager in Hybrid Environments <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html>`_ .

Options
=======

``--description`` (string)


  A userdefined description of the resource that you want to register with Amazon EC2. 

  

``--default-instance-name`` (string)


  The name of the registered, managed instance as it will appear in the Amazon EC2 console or when you use the AWS command line tools to list EC2 resources.

  

``--iam-role`` (string)


  The Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you want to assign to the managed instance. 

  

``--registration-limit`` (integer)


  Specify the maximum number of managed instances you want to register. The default value is 1 instance.

  

``--expiration-date`` (timestamp)


  The date by which this activation request should expire. The default value is 24 hours.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
