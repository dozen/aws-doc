Description
===========



Decreases the stream's retention period, which is the length of time data records are accessible after they are added to the stream. The minimum value of a streamâ€™s retention period is 24 hours. 

 

This operation may result in lost data. For example, if the stream's retention period is 48 hours and is decreased to 24 hours, any data already in the stream that is older than 24 hours is inaccessible.
