*****************

===========
Description
===========

Wait until ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when polling with ``describe-stream``. It will poll every 10 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 18 failed checks.

``stream-not-exists`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``StreamDescription.Shards``

Options
=======

``--stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the stream to describe.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page.

   

  

  

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified in max-items then a ``NextToken`` will be provided in the output that you can use to resume pagination. This ``NextToken`` response element should **not** be used directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (boolean)
Prints a sample input JSON to standard output. Note the specified operation is not run if this argument is specified. The sample input can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``.
