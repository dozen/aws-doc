**********************
stop-stream-encryption
**********************



===========
Description
===========



Disables server-side encryption for a specified stream. 

 

Stopping encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Amazon Kinesis returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to ``UPDATING`` . After the update is complete, Amazon Kinesis sets the status of the stream back to ``ACTIVE`` . Stopping encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is ``UPDATING`` . Once the status of the stream is ``ACTIVE`` records written to the stream will no longer be encrypted by the Amazon Kinesis Streams service. 

 

API Limits: You can successfully disable server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24 hour period. 

 

Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an ``ACTIVE`` status before all records written to the stream are no longer subject to encryption. After youâ€™ve disabled encryption, you can verify encryption was not applied by inspecting the API response from ``put-record`` or ``put-records`` .

Options

``--stream-name`` (string)


  The name of the stream on which to stop encrypting records.

  

``--encryption-type`` (string)


  The encryption type. This parameter can be one of the following values:

   

   
  * ``NONE`` : Not valid for this operation. An ``InvalidOperationException`` will be thrown. 
   
  * ``KMS`` : Use server-side encryption on the records in the stream using a customer-managed KMS key. 
   

  

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``NONE``

  
  *   ``KMS``

  

  

``--key-id`` (string)


  The GUID for the customer-managed key that was used for encryption.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
