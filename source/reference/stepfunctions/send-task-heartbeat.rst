*******************
send-task-heartbeat
*******************



===========
Description
===========



Used by workers to report to the service that the task represented by the specified ``taskToken`` is still making progress. This action resets the ``Heartbeat`` clock. The ``Heartbeat`` threshold is specified in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition. This action does not in itself create an event in the execution history. However, if the task times out, the execution history will contain an ``ActivityTimedOut`` event.

 

.. note::

   

  The ``Timeout`` of a task, defined in the state machine's Amazon States Language definition, is its maximum allowed duration, regardless of the number of  send-task-heartbeat requests received.

   

 

.. note::

   

  This operation is only useful for long-lived tasks to report the liveliness of the task.

Options

``--task-token`` (string)


  The token that represents this task. Task tokens are generated by the service when the tasks are assigned to a worker (see GetActivityTask::taskToken).

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
