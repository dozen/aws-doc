===========
Description
===========



Creates an AWS DMS event notification subscription. 

 

You can specify the type of source (``SourceType`` ) you want to be notified of, provide a list of AWS DMS source IDs (``SourceIds`` ) that triggers the events, and provide a list of event categories (``EventCategories`` ) for events you want to be notified of. If you specify both the ``SourceType`` and ``SourceIds`` , such as ``SourceType = replication-instance`` and ``SourceIdentifier = my-replinstance`` , you will be notified of all the replication instance events for the specified source. If you specify a ``SourceType`` but don't specify a ``SourceIdentifier`` , you receive notice of the events for that source type for all your AWS DMS sources. If you don't specify either ``SourceType`` nor ``SourceIdentifier`` , you will be notified of events generated from all AWS DMS sources belonging to your customer account.

 

For more information about AWS DMS events, see `Working with Events and Notifications <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Events.html>`_ in the AWS Database MIgration Service User Guide.

Options

``--subscription-name`` (string)


  The name of the DMS event notification subscription. 

   

  Constraints: The name must be less than 255 characters. 

  

``--sns-topic-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic created for event notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create a topic and subscribe to it. 

  

``--source-type`` (string)


  The type of AWS DMS resource that generates the events. For example, if you want to be notified of events generated by a replication instance, you set this parameter to ``replication-instance`` . If this value is not specified, all events are returned. 

   

  Valid values: replication-instance | migration-task

  

``--event-categories`` (list)


  A list of event categories for a source type that you want to subscribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given source type by calling the **describe-event-categories** action or in the topic `Working with Events and Notifications <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Events.html>`_ in the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide. 

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--source-ids`` (list)


  The list of identifiers of the event sources for which events will be returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the response. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. 

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--enabled`` | ``--no-enabled`` (boolean)


  A Boolean value; set to **true** to activate the subscription, or set to **false** to create the subscription but not activate it. 

  

``--tags`` (list)


  A tag to be attached to the event subscription.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
