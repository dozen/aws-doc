===========
Description
===========



Lists the handshakes that are associated with the organization that the requesting user is part of. The ``list-handshakes-for-organization`` operation returns a list of handshake structures. Each structure contains details and status about a handshake.

 

Handshakes that are ACCEPTED, DECLINED, or CANCELED appear in the results of this API for only 30 days after changing to that state. After that they are deleted and no longer accessible.

 

This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.



See also: `AWS API Documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/organizations-2016-11-28/ListHandshakesForOrganization>`_


``list-handshakes-for-organization`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Handshakes``

  [--filter <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--filter`` (structure)


  A filter of the handshakes that you want included in the response. The default is all types. Use the ``ActionType`` element to limit the output to only a specified type, such as ``INVITE`` , ``ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES`` , or ``APPROVE-ALL-FEATURES`` . Alternatively, for the ``ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES`` handshake that generates a separate child handshake for each member account, you can specify the ``ParentHandshakeId`` to see only the handshakes that were generated by that parent request.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    ActionType=string,ParentHandshakeId=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "ActionType": "INVITE"|"ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES"|"APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES",
    "ParentHandshakeId": "string"
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``next-token`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``next-token`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``next-token`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``next-token`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.



========
Examples
========

**To list all of the handshakes for the organization**

The following example shows how to get a list of handshakes that are associated with the current organization.  

Command::

  aws organizations list-handshakes-for-organization

The example response shows two handshakes. The first one is an invitation to Juan's account and shows a state of OPEN. The second is an invitation to Anika's account and shows a state of ACCEPTED.

Output
======

Handshakes -> (list)

  

  A list of  Handshake objects with details about each of the handshakes that are associated with an organization.

  

  (structure)

    

    Contains information that must be exchanged to securely establish a relationship between two accounts (an *originator* and a *recipient* ). For example, when a master account (the originator) invites another account (the recipient) to join its organization, the two accounts exchange information as a series of handshake requests and responses.

     

     **Note:** Handshakes that are CANCELED, ACCEPTED, or DECLINED show up in lists for only 30 days after entering that state After that they are deleted.

    

    Id -> (string)

      

      The unique identifier (ID) of a handshake. The originating account creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.

       

      The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`_ for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed by from 8 to 32 lower-case letters or digits.

      

      

    Arn -> (string)

      

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.

       

      For more information about ARNs in Organizations, see `ARN Formats Supported by Organizations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_permissions.html#orgs-permissions-arns>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

      

      

    Parties -> (list)

      

      Information about the two accounts that are participating in the handshake.

      

      (structure)

        

        Identifies a participant in a handshake.

        

        Id -> (string)

          

          The unique identifier (ID) for the party.

           

          The `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`_ for handshake ID string requires "h-" followed by from 8 to 32 lower-case letters or digits.

          

          

        Type -> (string)

          

          The type of party.

          

          

        

      

    State -> (string)

      

      The current state of the handshake. Use the state to trace the flow of the handshake through the process from its creation to its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid values is as follows:

       

       
      * **REQUESTED** : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all recipients have responded yet. The request stays in this state until all recipients respond. 
       
      * **OPEN** : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action. 
       
      * **CANCELED** : This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account. 
       
      * **ACCEPTED** : This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient. 
       
      * **DECLINED** : This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account. 
       
      * **EXPIRED** : This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days). 
       

      

      

    RequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the handshake request was made.

      

      

    ExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)

      

      The date and time that the handshake expires. If the recipient of the handshake request fails to respond before the specified date and time, the handshake becomes inactive and is no longer valid.

      

      

    Action -> (string)

      

      The type of handshake, indicating what action occurs when the recipient accepts the handshake.

      

      

    Resources -> (list)

      

      Additional information that is needed to process the handshake.

      

      (structure)

        

        Contains additional data that is needed to process a handshake.

        

        Value -> (string)

          

          The information that is passed to the other party in the handshake. The format of the value string must match the requirements of the specified type.

          

          

        Type -> (string)

          

          The type of information being passed, specifying how the value is to be interpreted by the other party:

           

           
          * ``ACCOUNT`` - Specifies an AWS account ID number. 
           
          * ``ORGANIZATION`` - Specifies an organization ID number. 
           
          * ``EMAIL`` - Specifies the email address that is associated with the account that receives the handshake.  
           
          * ``OWNER_EMAIL`` - Specifies the email address associated with the master account. Included as information about an organization.  
           
          * ``OWNER_NAME`` - Specifies the name associated with the master account. Included as information about an organization.  
           
          * ``NOTES`` - Additional text provided by the handshake initiator and intended for the recipient to read. 
           

          

          

        Resources -> (list)

          

          When needed, contains an additional array of ``HandshakeResource`` objects.

              * ``ACCOUNT`` - Specifies an AWS account ID number. 
               
              * ``ORGANIZATION`` - Specifies an organization ID number. 
               
              * ``EMAIL`` - Specifies the email address that is associated with the account that receives the handshake.  
               
              * ``OWNER_EMAIL`` - Specifies the email address associated with the master account. Included as information about an organization.  
               
              * ``OWNER_NAME`` - Specifies the name associated with the master account. Included as information about an organization.
