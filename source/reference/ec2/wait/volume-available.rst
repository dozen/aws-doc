===========
Description
===========

Wait until JMESPath query Volumes[].State returns available for all elements when polling with ``describe-volumes``. It will poll every 15 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 40 failed checks.

``volume-available`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Volumes``

``--filters`` (list)


  One or more filters.

   

   
  * ``attachment.attach-time`` - The time stamp when the attachment initiated. 
   
  * ``attachment.delete-on-termination`` - Whether the volume is deleted on instance termination. 
   
  * ``attachment.device`` - The device name that is exposed to the instance (for example, ``/dev/sda1`` ). 
   
  * ``attachment.instance-id`` - The ID of the instance the volume is attached to. 
   
  * ``attachment.status`` - The attachment state (``attaching`` | ``attached`` | ``detaching`` | ``detached`` ). 
   
  * ``availability-zone`` - The Availability Zone in which the volume was created. 
   
  * ``create-time`` - The time stamp when the volume was created. 
   
  * ``encrypted`` - The encryption status of the volume. 
   
  * ``size`` - The size of the volume, in GiB. 
   
  * ``snapshot-id`` - The snapshot from which the volume was created. 
   
  * ``status`` - The status of the volume (``creating`` | ``available`` | ``in-use`` | ``deleting`` | ``deleted`` | ``error`` ). 
   
  * ``tag`` :*key* =*value* - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Specify the key of the tag in the filter name and the value of the tag in the filter value. For example, for the tag Purpose=X, specify ``tag:Purpose`` for the filter name and ``X`` for the filter value. 
   
  * ``tag-key`` - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the ``tag-value`` filter. For example, if you use both the filter "tag-key=Purpose" and the filter "tag-value=X", you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the ``tag`` :*key* =*value* filter. 
   
  * ``tag-value`` - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the ``tag-key`` filter. 
   
  * ``volume-id`` - The volume ID. 
   
  * ``volume-type`` - The Amazon EBS volume type. This can be ``gp2`` for General Purpose SSD, ``io1`` for Provisioned IOPS SSD, ``st1`` for Throughput Optimized HDD, ``sc1`` for Cold HDD, or ``standard`` for Magnetic volumes.

``--volume-ids`` (list)


  One or more volume IDs.

  "string" "string" ...



``--dry-run`` | ``--no-dry-run`` (boolean)


  Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is ``DryRunOperation`` . Otherwise, it is ``UnauthorizedOperation`` .

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--page-size`` (integer)
 

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
