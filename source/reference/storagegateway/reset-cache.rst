.. _cli:aws storagegateway reset-cache:


***********
reset-cache
***********



===========
Description
===========



This operation resets all cache disks that have encountered a error and makes the disks available for reconfiguration as cache storage. If your cache disk encounters a error, the gateway prevents read and write operations on virtual tapes in the gateway. For example, an error can occur when a disk is corrupted or removed from the gateway. When a cache is reset, the gateway loses its cache storage. At this point you can reconfigure the disks as cache disks. 

 

.. warning::

   

  If the cache disk you are resetting contains data that has not been uploaded to Amazon S3 yet, that data can be lost. After you reset cache disks, there will be no configured cache disks left in the gateway, so you must configure at least one new cache disk for your gateway to function properly.
