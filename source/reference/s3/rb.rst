.. _cli:aws s3 rb:


**
rb
**



===========
Description
===========

Deletes an empty S3 bucket. A bucket must be completely empty of objects and versioned objects before it can be deleted. However, the ``--force`` parameter can be used to delete the non-versioned objects in the bucket before the bucket is deleted.



========
Synopsis
========

::

    rb
  <S3Uri>
  [--force]




=======
Options
=======

``path`` (string)


``--force`` (boolean)
Deletes all objects in the bucket including the bucket itself. Note that versioned objects will not be deleted in this process which would cause the bucket deletion to fail because the bucket would not be empty. To delete versioned objects use the ``s3api delete-object`` command with the ``--version-id`` parameter.



========
Examples
========

The following ``rb`` command removes a bucket.  In this example, the user's bucket is ``mybucket``.  Note that the bucket must be empty in order to remove::

    aws s3 rb s3://mybucket

Output::

    remove_bucket: mybucket

The following ``rb`` command uses the ``--force`` parameter to first remove all of the objects in the bucket and then
remove the bucket itself.  In this example, the user's bucket is ``mybucket`` and the objects in ``mybucket`` are
``test1.txt`` and ``test2.txt``::

    aws s3 rb s3://mybucket --force

Output::

    delete: s3://mybucket/test1.txt
    delete: s3://mybucket/test2.txt
    remove_bucket: mybucket
