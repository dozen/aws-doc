******************
delete-certificate
******************



===========
Description
===========



Deletes an ACM Certificate and its associated private key. If this action succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the list of ACM Certificates that can be displayed by calling the  list-certificates action or be retrieved by calling the  get-certificate action. The certificate will not be available for use by other AWS services.

 

.. note::

  You cannot delete an ACM Certificate that is being used by another AWS service. To delete a certificate that is in use, the certificate association must first be removed.
