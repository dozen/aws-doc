********************

********************



===========
Description
===========



Returns a list of the fields contained in the specified ACM Certificate. For example, this action returns the certificate status, a flag that indicates whether the certificate is associated with any other AWS service, and the date at which the certificate request was created. The ACM Certificate is specified on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Synopsis

::

    describe-certificate
  --certificate-arn <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton]




=======
Options
=======

``--certificate-arn`` (string)


  String that contains an ACM Certificate ARN. The ARN must be of the form: 

   

   ``arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012``  

   

  For more information about ARNs, see `Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and AWS Service Namespaces`_ . 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (boolean)
Prints a sample input JSON to standard output. Note the specified operation is not run if this argument is specified. The sample input can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``.



========
Examples
========

**To retrieve the fields contained in an ACM certificate**

The following ``describe-certificate`` command retrieves all of the fields for the certificate with the specified ARN::

  aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
