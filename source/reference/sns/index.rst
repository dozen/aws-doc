Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see `http\://aws.amazon.com/sns <http://aws.amazon.com/sns/>`_ . For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the `Amazon SNS Developer Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/>`_ . 

 

We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to `Tools for Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`_ .
