    describe-agents
  [--agent-ids <value>]

=======
Options
=======

``--agent-ids`` (list)


  The agent or the Connector IDs for which you want information. If you specify no IDs, the system returns information about all agents/Connectors associated with your AWS user account.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--filters`` (list)


  You can filter the request using various logical operators and a *key* -*value* format. For example: 

   

   ``{"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"}``  

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "values": ["string", ...],
      "condition": "string"
    }
    ...
  ]



``--max-results`` (integer)


  The total number of agents/Connectors to return in a single page of output. The maximum value is 100.

  

``--next-token`` (string)


  Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you previously specified 100 IDs for ``DescribeAgentsRequest$agentIds`` but set ``DescribeAgentsRequest$maxResults`` to 10, you received a set of 10 results along with a token. Use that token in this query to get the next set of 10.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.



========
Examples
========

**Describe agents with specified collectionStatus states**

This example command describes collection agents with collection status of "STARTED" or "STOPPED".

Command::

  aws discovery describe-agents --filters name="collectionStatus",values="STARTED","STOPPED",condition="EQUALS" --max-results 3

Output::
