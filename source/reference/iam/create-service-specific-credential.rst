**********************************
create-service-specific-credential
**********************************



===========
Description
===========



Generates a set of credentials consisting of a user name and password that can be used to access the service specified in the request. These credentials are generated by IAM, and can be used only for the specified service. 

 

You can have a maximum of two sets of service-specific credentials for each supported service per user.

 

The only supported service at this time is AWS CodeCommit.

 

You can reset the password to a new service-generated value by calling  reset-service-specific-credential .

 

For more information about service-specific credentials, see `Using IAM with AWS CodeCommit\: Git Credentials, SSH Keys, and AWS Access Keys <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_ssh-keys.html>`_ in the *IAM User Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--user-name`` (string)


  The name of the IAM user that is to be associated with the credentials. The new service-specific credentials have the same permissions as the associated user except that they can be used only to access the specified service.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`_ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-

  

``--service-name`` (string)


  The name of the AWS service that is to be associated with the credentials. The service you specify here is the only service that can be accessed using these credentials.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

    The name of the service associated with the service-specific credential.
