===========
Description
===========



Creates an IAM resource that describes an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0.

 

The SAML provider resource that you create with this operation can be used as a principal in an IAM role's trust policy to enable federated users who sign-in using the SAML IdP to assume the role. You can create an IAM role that supports Web-based single sign-on (SSO) to the AWS Management Console or one that supports API access to AWS.

 

When you create the SAML provider resource, you upload an a SAML metadata document that you get from your IdP and that includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that the IdP sends. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

 

.. note::

   

  This operation requires `Signature Version 4 <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html>`_ .

Options
=======

``--saml-metadata-document`` (string)


  An XML document generated by an identity provider (IdP) that supports SAML 2.0. The document includes the issuer's name, expiration information, and keys that can be used to validate the SAML authentication response (assertions) that are received from the IdP. You must generate the metadata document using the identity management software that is used as your organization's IdP.

   

  For more information, see `About SAML 2.0-based Federation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html>`_ in the *IAM User Guide*  

  

``--name`` (string)


  The name of the provider to create.

   

  This parameter allows (per its `regex pattern <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex>`_ ) a string of characters consisting of upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include any of the following characters: =,.@-

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.



========
Examples
========

**To create a SAML provider**

This example creates a new SAML provider in IAM named ``MySAMLProvider``. It is described by the SAML metadata document found in the file ``SAMLMetaData.xml``::

  aws iam create-saml-provider --saml-metadata-document file://SAMLMetaData.xml --name MySAMLProvider


Output::

  {
      "SAMLProviderArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:saml-provider/MySAMLProvider"
  }
