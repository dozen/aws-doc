create-event-subscription
*************************



===========
Description
===========



Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action requires an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of an Amazon SNS topic created by either the Amazon Redshift console, the Amazon SNS console, or the Amazon SNS API. To obtain an ARN with Amazon SNS, you must create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS console. 

 

You can specify the source type, and lists of Amazon Redshift source IDs, event categories, and event severities. Notifications will be sent for all events you want that match those criteria. For example, you can specify source type = cluster, source ID = my-cluster-1 and mycluster2, event categories = Availability, Backup, and severity = ERROR. The subscription will only send notifications for those ERROR events in the Availability and Backup categories for the specified clusters. 

 

If you specify both the source type and source IDs, such as source type = cluster and source identifier = my-cluster-1, notifications will be sent for all the cluster events for my-cluster-1. If you specify a source type but do not specify a source identifier, you will receive notice of the events for the objects of that type in your AWS account. If you do not specify either the SourceType nor the SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of events generated from all Amazon Redshift sources belonging to your AWS account. You must specify a source type if you specify a source ID.

=======
Options
=======

``--subscription-name`` (string)


  The name of the event subscription to be created. 

   

  Constraints:

   

   
  * Cannot be null, empty, or blank.
   
  * Must contain from 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.
   
  * First character must be a letter.
   
  * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
   

  

``--sns-topic-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic used to transmit the event notifications. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create a topic and subscribe to it. 

  

``--source-type`` (string)


  The type of source that will be generating the events. For example, if you want to be notified of events generated by a cluster, you would set this parameter to cluster. If this value is not specified, events are returned for all Amazon Redshift objects in your AWS account. You must specify a source type in order to specify source IDs. 

   

  Valid values: cluster, cluster-parameter-group, cluster-security-group, and cluster-snapshot.

  

``--source-ids`` (list)


  A list of one or more identifiers of Amazon Redshift source objects. All of the objects must be of the same type as was specified in the source type parameter. The event subscription will return only events generated by the specified objects. If not specified, then events are returned for all objects within the source type specified. 

   

  Example: my-cluster-1, my-cluster-2

   

  Example: my-snapshot-20131010

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--event-categories`` (list)


  Specifies the Amazon Redshift event categories to be published by the event notification subscription.

   

  Values: Configuration, Management, Monitoring, Security

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--severity`` (string)


  Specifies the Amazon Redshift event severity to be published by the event notification subscription.

   

  Values: ERROR, INFO

  

``--enabled`` | ``--no-enabled`` (boolean)


  A Boolean value; set to ``true`` to activate the subscription, set to ``false`` to create the subscription but not active it. 

  

``--tags`` (list)


  A list of tag instances.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    Key=string,Value=string ...




JSON Syntax::

  [
    {
      "Key": "string",
      "Value": "string"
    }

  ]



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (boolean)
Prints a sample input JSON to standard output. Note the specified operation is not run if this argument is specified. The sample input can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``.
