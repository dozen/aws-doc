===========
Description
===========

 

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.

 

With ElastiCache, customers gain all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with far less of the administrative burden of launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.

 

In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.
