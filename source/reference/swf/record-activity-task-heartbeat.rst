******************************
record-activity-task-heartbeat
******************************



===========
Description
===========



Used by activity workers to report to the service that the  ActivityTask represented by the specified ``taskToken`` is still making progress. The worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent complete, using the ``details`` parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the boolean ``cancelRequested`` flag returned by the service is set to ``true`` .

 

This action resets the ``taskHeartbeatTimeout`` clock. The ``taskHeartbeatTimeout`` is specified in  register-activity-type .

 

This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history contains a ``ActivityTaskTimedOut`` event that contains the information from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.

 

.. note::

   

  The ``taskStartToCloseTimeout`` of an activity type is the maximum duration of an activity task, regardless of the number of  record-activity-task-heartbeat requests received. The ``taskStartToCloseTimeout`` is also specified in  register-activity-type .

   

 

.. note::

   

  This operation is only useful for long-lived activities to report liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being attempted.

   

 

.. warning::

   

  If the ``cancelRequested`` flag returns ``true`` , a cancellation is being attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with  respond-activity-task-canceled . Otherwise, it should ignore the cancellation request.

   

 

 **Access Control**  

 

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:

 

 
* Use a ``Resource`` element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains. 
 
* Use an ``Action`` element to allow or deny permission to call this action. 
 
* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters. 
 

 

If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's ``cause`` parameter is set to ``OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`` . For details and example IAM policies, see `Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/swf-dev-iam.html>`_ in the *Amazon SWF Developer Guide* .

=======
Options
=======

``--task-token`` (string)


  The ``taskToken`` of the  ActivityTask .

   

  .. warning::

     

     ``taskToken`` is generated by the service and should be treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another process, its ``taskToken`` must also be passed. This enables it to provide its progress and respond with results. 

     

  

``--details`` (string)


  If specified, contains details about the progress of the task.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.



======
Output
======

cancelRequested -> (boolean)

  

  Set to ``true`` if cancellation of the task is requested.
