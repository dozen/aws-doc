AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about AWS Directory Services features, see `AWS Directory Service <https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/>`_ and the `AWS Directory Service Administration Guide <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html>`_ .

 

.. note::

   

  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory Service and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see `Tools for Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/>`_ .
