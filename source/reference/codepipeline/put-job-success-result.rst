Options

``--job-id`` (string)


  The unique system-generated ID of the job that succeeded. This is the same ID returned from PollForJobs.

  

``--current-revision`` (structure)


  The ID of the current revision of the artifact successfully worked upon by the job.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    revision=string,changeIdentifier=string,created=timestamp,revisionSummary=string




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "revision": "string",
    "changeIdentifier": "string",
    "created": timestamp,
    "revisionSummary": "string"
  }



``--continuation-token`` (string)


  A token generated by a job worker, such as an AWS CodeDeploy deployment ID, that a successful job provides to identify a custom action in progress. Future jobs will use this token in order to identify the running instance of the action. It can be reused to return additional information about the progress of the custom action. When the action is complete, no continuation token should be supplied.

  

``--execution-details`` (structure)


  The execution details of the successful job, such as the actions taken by the job worker.

  



Shorthand Syntax::

    summary=string,externalExecutionId=string,percentComplete=integer




JSON Syntax::

  {
    "summary": "string",
    "externalExecutionId": "string",
    "percentComplete": integer
  }



``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
