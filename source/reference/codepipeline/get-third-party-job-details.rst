get-third-party-job-details
***************************



===========
Description
===========



Requests the details of a job for a third party action. Only used for partner actions.

 

.. warning::

   

  When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary credentials for the Amazon S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if the action requires access to that Amazon S3 bucket for input or output artifacts. Additionally, this API returns any secret values defined for the action.

Synopsis
========

::

    get-third-party-job-details
  --job-id <value>
  --client-token <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]




=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The unique system-generated ID used for identifying the job.

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its details.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
