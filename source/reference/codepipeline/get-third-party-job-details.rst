***************************
get-third-party-job-details
***************************



===========
Description
===========



Requests the details of a job for a third party action. Only used for partner actions.

 

.. warning::

  

  When this API is called, AWS CodePipeline returns temporary credentials for the Amazon S3 bucket used to store artifacts for the pipeline, if the action requires access to that Amazon S3 bucket for input or output artifacts. Additionally, this API returns any secret values defined for the action.

Synopsis
========

::

    get-third-party-job-details
  --job-id <value>
  --client-token <value>
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton]




=======
Options
=======

``--job-id`` (string)


  The unique system-generated ID used for identifying the job.

  

``--client-token`` (string)


  The clientToken portion of the clientId and clientToken pair used to verify that the calling entity is allowed access to the job and its details.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (boolean)
Prints a sample input JSON to standard output. Note the specified operation is not run if this argument is specified. The sample input can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``.
