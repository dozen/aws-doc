``--stack-name`` (string)


  The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack.

  

``--retain-resources`` (list)


  For stacks in the ``DELETE_FAILED`` state, a list of resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion, AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources.

   

  Retaining resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack.

  



Syntax::

  "string" "string" ...



``--role-arn`` (string)


  The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.

   

  If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

  

``--client-request-token`` (string)


  A unique identifier for this ``delete-stack`` request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to delete a stack with the same name. You might retry ``delete-stack`` requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

   

  All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a ``create-stack`` operation with the token ``token1`` , then all the ``StackEvents`` generated by that operation will have ``client-request-token`` set as ``token1`` .

   

  In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format *Console-StackOperation-ID* , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: ``Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002`` . 

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
