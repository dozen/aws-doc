*********************



===========
Description
===========

Wait until stack status is UPDATE_COMPLETE. It will poll every 30 seconds until a successful state has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 120 failed checks.

``stack-update-complete`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.
When using ``--output text`` and the ``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Stacks``

Options

``--stack-name`` (string)


  The name or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack, which are not always interchangeable:

   

   
  * Running stacks: You can specify either the stack's name or its unique stack ID. 
   
  * Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID. 
   

   

  Default: There is no default value.

  

``--cli-input-json`` (string)
Performs service operation based on the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by ``--generate-cli-skeleton``. If other arguments are provided on the command line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values.

``--starting-token`` (string)
 

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``next-token`` from a previously truncated response.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--max-items`` (integer)
 

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``next-token`` is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the ``next-token`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent command. **Do not** use the ``next-token`` response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.

   

  For usage examples, see `Pagination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/pagination.html>`_ in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide* .

   

``--generate-cli-skeleton`` (string)
Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value ``input``, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for ``--cli-input-json``. If provided with the value ``output``, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
